My approach for the project was to build the user stories, wire frames, and ERD's for the project.  Once an idea for the app was
reached, I was able to build the basic structure of the app.  


There were many unsolved problems for this app, mainly along the lines of functionallity and styling.  Area's for improvement to 
the app include:

- Imrpoved styling for the homepage, as well as additional styling and backgroudns for subsequent pages.

- User login and passowrd functionallity.

- Additional functionallity within site, such as additional picutes and information to render per attraction, link to webite for attraction.  Also additional attractions sorted by category, and user rating system.
